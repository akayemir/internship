# Day 1 – Introduction to Git

## ✅ Objectives
- [x] Set up GitHub account
- [x] Fork the internship repo
- [x] Start learning about **Monitoring**
- [x] Finish implementation of **Binary Search, Recursive Factorial, Recursice Fibonacci** algorithms

## 📘 What I Learned

* Started learning about monitoring. Learned the differences between **Metrics,tracing and logging**.
* Learned about Prometheus and Grafana. Dowloaded Docker to set up my monitoring system.
* Wrote Binary Search, factorial, fibonacci codes to understand and learn more about algorithms.

## ❓ Questions
Why do I need OpenTelemetry when Prometheus and Grafana work fine?

## 💬 Reflection
Need to learn more about monitoring. Coding and environment part of it is so different from what I've learned so far.
