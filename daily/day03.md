# Day 3 – Collecting Metric

## ✅ Objectives
- [x] The .NET project has been created
- [x] OpenTelemetry has been integrated
- [x] Prometheus has been configured to scrape the metrics
- [x] The data has been visualized in Grafana (HTTP Active Request, Server Request Duration)

## 📘 What I Learned

* Learned more about OpenTelemetry and .NET.
* Integrated a basic .NET project with OpenTelemetry, Docker, Prometheus, Grafana.

## ❓ Questions
How can I create my own metrics?

## 💬 Reflection
Need to learn how to containerize the WebAPI so that the project can be run using just Docker, without relying on an IDE.
