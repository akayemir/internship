## ✅ Objectives
- [x] Wrote readme for Dijkstra and Greedy algorithms
- [x] Started a new Demo Project to learn **Push Method**

## 📘 What I Learned

* Learned how to configure push method and change the metric labels, so it becomes easier for Headquarter to identify the source of the data. 

## ❓ Questions
How can I make my Grafana dashboard ready to use immediately after import, without requiring any manual changes? (Prometheus configuration)
