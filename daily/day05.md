# Day 5 – Algorithms and Demo Project

## ✅ Objectives
- [x] Finished implentation of a phonebook **Hash Table** algorithm
- [x] A maze **BFS** algorithm
- [x] A shortest path **Dijkstra** algorithm
- [x] A money exchange **Greedy** algorithm
- [x] Started doing research about the new demo project (APIs and configuration)


## 📘 What I Learned

* Learned writing Dijkstra can be so confusing and exhausting

## ❓ Questions
How can I fetch data from external APIs and expose them as custom metrics in my .NET application? 

## 💬 Reflection
Need to practice more on my algorithms to get faster.
