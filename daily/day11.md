# Day 11 – Finalizing Dashboard and Writing ReadMe files

## ✅ Objectives
- [x] I added a global variable and a dropdown menu, allowing station data to be displayed separately in the graphs. This enables users to switch between different stations' data with a single selection.
- [x] Wrote readme files for **QuickSort, Hash Tables, BFS**.


## 📘 What I Learned

* Learned how to create a custom global variable on Grafana

## ❓ Questions
What can I do to improve this Demo Project?

## 💬 Reflection
Initially, setting up the dropdown variable was a bit confusing, but after some experimentation I was able to configure it correctly.
