# Binary Search Algorithm

This project compares the execution times of the **Linear Search** and **Binary Search** algorithms across arrays of various sizes and search conditions.

## üìå Description

The goal of this code is to measure how both search algorithms perform under different conditions by analyzing execution times. The test is performed using 10 different array sizes, and each array is searched under four different scenarios.

---

## üß™ Array Sizes Tested

10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, 50000, 100000, 150000

---

## üîç Search Conditions

1. Target element is **near the beginning** of the array  
2. Target element is **near the middle** of the array  
3. Target element is **near the end** of the array  
4. Target element **does not exist** in the array

## üìä Conclusion

The experiment highlights the significant performance difference between **O(n)** and **O(log n)** algorithms as the array size increases. Even at a relatively small size like **150,000 elements**, the **Binary Search** algorithm demonstrates a speed advantage being up to **1000 times faster** than **Linear Search** in some cases.

---

## üß† Observations

- The location of the target value (beginning, middle, end) greatly impacts the execution time of **Linear Search**, but has minimal effect on **Binary Search**.
- These results align with theoretical time complexities and emphasize the importance of choosing the right algorithm for the problem.
