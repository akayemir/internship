# QuickSort Algorithm

This project creates a 10000 sized array with random generated numbers. Sorts this array with quicksort algorithm and checks if this array is sorted correctly.

## üìå Description

The goal of this code is to do an implemantation practice of the quicksort algorithm and understand how it works.

| Function Name             | Description                                                                                |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `void arrayMaker()`       | Fills the array with randomly generated integers                                           |
| `int pivotSupposedIndex()`| Finds the pivot index and swap elements to arrange the array according to pivot            |
| `void quickSort()`        | Initially calls pivotSupposedIndex, then calls itself for the left and right side of pivot |
| `bool isSorted()`         | For loop to check if quickSort is executed correctly                                       |

## üìä Conclusion

QuickSort is a sorting algorithm that selects a pivot index, places it in its correct position, and then recursively divides the array (divide and conquer). It has an average time complexity of **O(n log n)** and a worst-case of **O(n¬≤)**. Although MergeSort offers similar time complexity, QuickSort is more widely used in practice due to its **lower memory usage** thanks to its in-place sorting nature.
