Welcome to the Internship Program!  
My name is Emir Akay.  
I am a Computer Science Undergraduate at Bilkent University.  
This repository contains the work I did during my internship, which took place between July 10, 2025 and August 7, 2025.  
This internship focused on two main areas: (1) improving algorithmic thinking using the book **Grokking Algorithms**, and (2) developing a monitoring project from scratch using **OpenTelemetry, Prometheus and Grafana**.
